# Learning outcome

Students are expected to have some practice on arrays/2D arrays/parameter passing/method construction and usage in this assignment. We expect most students would spend six hours or more to finish the assignment without any assistance. Make sure you start earlier as possible and ask us on Discord if you have any difficulty! Note: we want to familiarize arrays and 2D arrays, so you are not supposed (and not allowed) to use advanced data structures like ArrayList, Set, Map, etc...


# Introduction

You are going to complete the Block Puzzle program! Open [BlockPuzzle.java](BlockPuzzle.java) and complete the methods stated in the skeleton code. Some of these methods are very straightforward while some of them ain't that easy. Make sure you can follow the instructions given at the top of each method.

A [sample program](demo.jar) is given to you. When there is something you are not sure, you can take a look at the sample program to decide what to do. 

Some methods are labeled as completed or given. Please don't make any change on those methods. You are not supposed to modify them. **You can add your own method if you want to**. However, you are not allowed to introduce any class variable (field) or additional class. Whenever possible, please refer the constant variables (`PUZZLES`, `ROW`, `COL`, `ROUND`, `SCORES`) defined in the program.
