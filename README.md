# Block Puzzle Game

## Overview

Welcome to my personal project: the **Block Puzzle Game**! This is a fun and engaging puzzle game where players aim to strategically place blocks on a grid to clear rows and columns. I've created this game as a way to practice my programming skills, particularly in Java, and to deepen my understanding of arrays and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are to:

- **Practice Java Programming**: Focus on using arrays and 2D arrays without relying on advanced data structures.
- **Understand Game Logic**: Implement the rules and mechanics of a classic block puzzle game.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills**: Develop algorithms to manage game states and user interactions.

## Getting Started

To run the Block Puzzle Game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/khwang0/COMP2045-2425PA1.git
   cd COMP2045-2425PA1
   ```

2. **Download the Demo**: You can download the demo program [here](demo.jar).

3. **Run the Demo**:
   Open your terminal and execute the following command:
   ```sh
   java -jar demo.jar
   ```

## Gameplay

In the Block Puzzle Game, you'll face random puzzles that you need to place on an 8x9 grid. The goal is to fill rows and columns to score points. Here are the key features:

- **Puzzle Placement**: You cannot rotate blocks, and they must fit within the grid without overlapping.
- **Scoring System**: Clear rows or columns to earn points. The game ends when no more blocks can be placed.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Java fundamentals.
- Improve my understanding of game design principles.
- Learn to manage game states and user input effectively.
